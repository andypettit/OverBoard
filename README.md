# OverBoard
Web-based scoreboard overlay, rosters, and map information for use in a browser source for stream broadcasting software for live streaming.

This project uses Socket.IO and Node.js to live update the score through a separate control page avoiding hard refreshes and the blinking that causes within OBS browser source.
